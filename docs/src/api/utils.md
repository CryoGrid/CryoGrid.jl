# [Utility methods and types](@id utils)

This module provides miscellaneous utility methods and types that are used throughout the `CryoGrid.jl` codebase. Note that the `Utils` module is not exported by the top-level `CryoGrid` module. It may, however, be explicitly imported by the user via `using CryoGrid.Utils` or `import CryoGrid.Utils` when needed.
