# CryoGrid.jl

`CryoGrid.jl` is a Julia implementation of the CryoGrid land surface model using `DifferentialEquations.jl` and the [SciML](https://github.com/SciML)
package ecosystem. Its primary goal is to provide a fast, flexible, and feature rich framework for modeling permafrost in Julia while simultaneously laying the groundwork for rapid prototyping of data-driven parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, and causal analysis of complex Arctic land surface processes.

This package is part of the broader research project: [Quantifying and explaining uncertainty in permafrost modeling under a warming climate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wB_EXtlO_PMXFSzZ-bRV8cg0a0DGDtAB/view?usp=sharing)
